Today, its fleet carries more than a million passengers each year to more worldwide destinations than any other major line. <br><br> The most recognized cruise line in the world was catapulted to stardom in 1977 when Pacific Princess was cast in a starring role on a new television show called The Love Boat. The weekly series, which introduced millions of viewers to the still-new concept of a sea-going vacation, was an instant hit and both the company name and its "seawitch" logo have remained synonymous with cruising ever since. <br><br> Princess\' modern fleet has grown considerably in recent years to include Caribbean Princess, Coral Princess, Crown Princess, Dawn Princess, Diamond Princess, Emerald Princess, Golden Princess, Grand Princess, Island Princess, Regal Princess, Royal Princess, Ruby Princess<sup>SM</sup>, Sapphire Princess, Sea Princess, Star Princess and Sun Princess.<br><br> <strong>Personal Choice Cruising </strong> <br><br> Building on past success, Princess is continually evolving to meet the needs of the today\'s vacationer. In the mid-1990s the company pioneered the concept of putting passengers in control of their own cruise experience with the introduction of its Sun-class ships. These revolutionary vessels gave passengers the freedom to choose from a wide range of flexible onboard facilities, amenities and services in order to create a personal vacation experience that takes the regimentation out of the cruise experience and suits each passenger\'s own needs and preferences. <br><br> Today, the line\'s signature emphasis on Personal Choice Cruising is apparent across the fleet, with each vessel offering its own unique version on a host of multiple dining options and locations; flexible and varied entertainment selections; renowned customer service; and a full complement of onboard activities including a variety of ScholarShip@Sea enrichment classes featuring computer training, ceramics, culinary arts, finance and photography. Often copied but never duplicated, the Princess concept of cruise vacation customization has since been adopted as the touchstone of new ship design for the entire cruise industry. <br><br> <strong>Affordable Luxury and an Abundance of Balconies </strong> <br><br> In addition to incorporating a wide range of choices, vessels in the Princess fleet are specifically designed to provide the ultimate in affordable luxury, with an emphasis on "Big Ship Choice, Small Ship Feel" No matter the size of the ship, public spaces are designed to feel intimate and are decorated in a contemporary style, allowing passengers to enjoy themselves in an informal, relaxed onboard atmosphere that mirrors today\'s lifestyles. The company has also long been the leader in building ships specifically designed to accommodate an extensive number of the most sought-after shipboard luxury -- the private balcony. In the mid-1980s Princess pioneered the concept of the affordable veranda, once an exclusive feature incorporated in only the most expensive suites. Today, Princess\' fleet offers one of the highest percentages of balcony cabins in the industry, across all cabin categories. The physical design and dcor of the ships, coupled with Princess\' hallmark service excellence, creates an onboard atmosphere of relaxed luxury in which passengers can enjoy their perfect vacation experience. <br><br> <strong>Worldwide Destinations </strong> <br><br> Princess\' philosophy of choice is also reflected in its sailing schedule. Offering voyages to more worldwide cruise destinations than any other major line, Princess has more than 90 unique itineraries ranging from seven to 102 days. The line sails to all seven continents and calls at nearly 270 ports around the world. Princess passengers can enhance their cruise experience through the Adventures Ashore program featuring more than 1,500 in-port excursions worldwide, and the company\'s expanding cruisetour offerings enable passengers to combine their cruise with a full land tour. Destinations on all seven continents include the Caribbean, Alaska, Panama Canal, Europe, Mexican Riviera, South America, Australia/New Zealand, South Pacific, Hawaii, Tahiti/French Polynesia, Asia, Canada/New England, Antarctica and World Cruise. <br><br> Having led the way in Gulf of Alaska cruising, Princess maintains a strong presence in Alaska. Through its Seattle-based Princess Tours division, the company operates a wide variety of spectacular land and sea experiences in the majestic "Land of the Midnight Sun." The largest cruise and tour operator in the state, Princess operates seven cruise ships, five riverside wilderness lodges, luxury Midnight Sun Express Ultra Dome rail cars, and a fleet of deluxe motor coaches; allowing cruise passengers to connect seamlessly to a landside tour and experience several distinctly unique facets of the Alaska wilderness in a single trip.</p>', '/images/cruise_lines/Princess/logos/logo.gif', 'princess-cruises'),

Mariotti yard in Genoa. Her debut was on June 6, 2010 in the middle of the River Thames in London. Seabourn Sojourn’s godmother was the English fashion icon and actress Twiggy. Like her sisters, Seabourn Sojourn enchants her guests with an array of public areas scaled to encourage a relaxed sociability. One of the most unusual features of Seabourn Sojourn and her sisters is Seabourn Square, an ingenious “living room” that replaces the traditional cruise ship lobby with a welcoming lounge filled with easy chairs, sofas and cocktail tables. An enclave in its center houses knowledgeable concierges discreetly seated at individual desks, ready to handle all sorts of business or give advice and information. The ship’s shops are conveniently located just off the Square and it has its own open terrace aft. The Spa at Seabourn is the largest on any ultra-luxury ship, 11,400 square feet encompassing indoor and outdoor space over two decks. A variety of open terraces are scattered over seven decks, offering places to gather with a few friends or spend an isolated hour with a book. Seabourn Sojourn offers six whirlpools and two swimming pools, including the Pool Patio, with a pair of large whirlpool spas and a “beach” style pool, a casual Patio Grill and the Patio Bar. On the sun deck above sits Seabourn’s popular open-air Sky Bar. High atop Deck 11 is a Sun Terrace with 36 tiered double sun beds. Just aft of that is The Retreat, with shuffleboard courts and a nine-hole putting green. The panoramic Observation Bar on Deck 10 offers 270° forward views over the sea. The Club is a lively spot for dancing before and after dinner, while the larger Grand Salon is used for dancing as well as lectures, production vocal shows, cabaret performances and classical recitals.</span></p>', 'https://cruiseplannersnet.com/images/cruise_lines/Seabourn/Sojourn/ship.jpg', '/resized/125/63/images/cruise_lines/Seabourn/Sojourn/ship.jpg', 2, 'seabourn-sojourn'),

Seabourn Quest offers a variety of dining options to suit every taste and every mood, with never an extra charge. The Restaurant is the main dining venue on board, serving multi-course breakfasts, luncheons and dinners in an open-seating style amid a refined setting of gleaming white linens, polished alabaster walls, flowing sheer draperies and glittering crystal chandeliers. Menus reflect an insistence on fresh, high-quality ingredients, masterful preparation and appealing presentations. In a signature Seabourn salute to personalization, guests are invited to order from the Restaurant menu during extended service hours, and have their meal served in the privacy of their suites or on their verandas. Located all the way aft on Deck 8, the Colonnade is a more casual, very popular indoor/outdoor option serving lavish station-style buffet breakfasts and lunches. Dinners in the Colonnade are regionally-themed menus prepared in the open kitchen and served at table. Restaurant 2 is an intimate setting where guests can enjoy innovative small-plates tasting menus nightly by reservation. The Patio Grill is a casual alternative offering poolside dining for luncheons and dinners, as well as freshly baked pizzas from its on-site oven all afternoon. Festive beach barbecues are frequent highlights on warm-water cruises, with lavish steak-and-seafood grills and Seabourn’s Signature Caviar in the Surf event.

Seabourn Odyssey was built by the Italian company T. Mariotti S.p.A., located in Genoa, Italy and named in Venice in June of 2009. On that occasion, the guests on board for the maiden voyage were all honored as the ship’s godparents, and a plaque with their names was permanently mounted on a wall inside the ship. Seabourn Odyssey was designed by the same architectural team, Petr Yran and Bjorn Storbraaten, who designed the original Seabourn ships. Seabourn Odyssey’s 225 ocean-view suites are divided into 13 categories, with interior measurements from 295 to over 1,200 square feet. Ninety percent have private verandas, which add from 65 to over 350 square feet of additional private living space. Highlights in accommodations are the exceptional Wintergarden Suites, which have a private glassed-in Solarium with a soaking tub and a lounging bed. This suite also features a veranda that is bowed out, giving wonderful views long the side of the ship. The Signature Suites, located all the way forward on Deck 7, have over 900 square feet of inside space and a spectacular wrap-around veranda of 353 square feet.

With that in mind, I have designed a ship that is imbued with a sense of spontaneity and exhilaration, to elicit surprise and delight that will complement the rest of the guests’ travel experiences.”</p><p> </p><p>Although the architecture of Seabourn Encore is not radically different from Seabourn’s other three ships, Tihany’s vision is present throughout the ship.

Most of the 550,000 inhabitants of Alaska are of Aleutian, Indian and Eskimom origin; settlers dating back almost 8,000 years.

Roughly one third of Alaska’s territory lies above the Arctic Circle, a land of extreme landscapes and untamed beauty. Steep mountain ranges, coastal plains, rugged tundra, and polar habitats thriving with wildlife are some of the natural attractions here, while the native Eskimo culture provides a fascinating element to a region that may otherwise seem unfit for human life. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span></span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Alaska%20-%20Northbound', 1, 'alaska-northbound', 0, 'Alaska - Northbound'),

As one of the richest salmon areas in the world, southwest Alaska draws record numbers of wildlife species, as well as travelers eager to unlock all its natural treasures. </span></span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Alaska%20-%20Southbound', 1, 'alaska-southbound', 0, 'Alaska - Southbound'),

The landscape of this region was shaped millions of years ago by massive glaciers, and the irregular and jagged nature of these coasts seems tailor-made for exploring aboard a cruise ship.

The country’s immerse diversity—reflected in its landscapes, climates and endemic species—has long fascinated visitors. Add its cosmopolitan cities to the mix and it’s easy to see why this vast nation straddling the Indian and Pacific oceans is a must for any traveler’s bucket list. Cruise ships call at numerous Australian ports, including Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart and Darwin.

Often overshadowed by its larger, more popular Oceanian neighbor (and we use that term loosely) Australia, New Zealand rewards travelers with breathtaking sceneries, endless stretches of beaches, and welcoming locals in a decidedly smaller package.

After all, the French called this <em>Indochine,</em> relying on the fact that it’s located roughly between India and China. But that label feels like a disservice to the culturally rich and fiercely distinct nature of the nations that comprise Southeast Asia.

The Spanish would have as well, were it not for the U.S., but their 300-year rule in these lands can still be felt in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Mexico.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: \'Arial\',sans-serif;">It’s almost impossible to describe the Caribbean as a whole (unless “sunny with plenty of beaches” counts as a description!). And for many travelers, it’s equally difficult to choose one Caribbean destination. Do you want the colonial charms of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico or the pink-sand beaches of the Bahamas? Do you prefer the picturesque waterfalls of Jamaica or the shipwrecks off Cayman Islands? </span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Caribbean%20-%20Extended', 5, 'caribbean-extended', 0, 'Caribbean - Extended'),
(38, 'Caribbean - Southern', '<p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: \'Arial\',sans-serif;">By being farther from the U.S. mainland, the islands in the Southern Caribbean tend to be the road less traveled in this tropical region. Places such as Martinique, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines or the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao) retain a more exotic feel than other Caribbean destinations. These islands are also incredibly diverse, ranging from mountainous tropical wonderlands covered in lush rainforests to windswept, rocky havens with beaches that will remind you why you came to the Caribbean.</span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Caribbean%20-%20Southern', 5, 'caribbean-southern', 1, 'Southern Caribbean'),

The fact that it’s the closest region of the Caribbean to the mainland U.S. certainly helps as well. Loosely defined as the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, and Honduras, as well as the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, the destinations here offer a diverse and always enriching experience.</span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Caribbean%20-%20Western', 5, 'caribbean-western', 1, 'Western Caribbean'),

Cruise lines of all sizes and budgets offer itineraries that either remain solely within these waters or include one or more of its ports of call. With Puerto Rico serving as the Eastern Caribbean’s main travel hub, the region is usually defined as including the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands, St. Martin, Anguilla, St. Barth’s, Saint Eustatius, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Antigua and Barbuda.</span></p>', 'http://www.redhotcruiseplanners.com/subregions/view/Caribbean%20-%20Eastern', 5, 'caribbean-eastern', 1, 'Eastern Caribbean'),

A mere 50 miles from the coast of Florida, this archipelago in the Caribbean has more than 700 islands and is known for its pristine beaches, watersports such as boating and fishing, duty-free shopping and colorful culture. As cruise ships call year-round at Nassau, Freeport, and a host of secluded private islands, anytime is a good time to visit the islands of The Bahamas.
